To start this assingment, I created a few functions that would either add, subtract, multiply, divide, or take the reciprocal.  I also added gcd so that it would take the greatest common denominator as well as reduced format to combine both the numerator and denominator.  I then asked the user for a 1-6 which would either add, subtract, multiply, divide, quit, or take the reciprocal and ask for a separate number that it would add, subtract, multiply, or divide by.  I also had to add that if the numerator or denominator was 0, it wuold ask again.
